This Pine Script creates a checklist table displayed in the bottom-right corner of the chart. It shows:
1. Whether the next earnings date is within the next 2 weeks
2. Whether the current month is a traditionally weak month (May, August, or September)

Each row includes:
• A check title
• The current value (e.g., date or month)
• A ❌ red cross if the condition is met (warning signal)

Useful for quickly assessing seasonal and earnings-related risks.
